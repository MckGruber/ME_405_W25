Base Chassis
************

The base chassis of the Romi robot is a compact and lightweight design that allows for easy maneuverability and stability. The chassis is made of durable materials and is designed to accommodate the various components of the robot. 
The chassis is equipped with mounting points for the motors, sensors, and microcontroller. The chassis also includes a battery compartment for easy access to the power supply. The full chasis unit can be directly purchased from polulu's website 
(`<https://www.pololu.com/category/202/romi-chassis-and-accessories>`_).

Microcontroller
***************

The microcontroller used in this project is the Nucleo STM32-L476RG. This microcontroller is based on the ARM Cortex-M4 architecture and features a 32-bit processor with a maximum clock speed of 80 MHz. It has 512 KB of Flash memory and 128 KB of SRAM,
making it suitable for complex applications. The Nucleo board also includes a USB interface for programming and debugging, as well as a variety of GPIO pins for connecting to sensors and other peripherals. The Nucleo board is compatible with the Arduino IDE, 
making it easy to program and develop applications. For our project specifically, we used the Nucleo board in conjuction with the shoe of brian developed by professor spluttflob (`<https://spluttflob.github.io/ME405-Support/shoe_info.html>`_) to provide 
more a stable USB interface for running the micropython code.

Sensors
*******

The Romi robot is equipped with several sensors to enable it to navigate and follow lines. The sensors used in this project include:

- **QTR-HD-13A Reflectance Array**: This sensor array consists of 13 infrared reflectance sensors that can detect the presence of a line on the ground. The sensors are arranged in a line and can be used to determine the position of the line relative to the robot. 
 The QTR-HD-13A sensor is capable of detecting both black and white lines, making it suitable for a variety of line-following applications.

- **BNO055 IMU**: The BNO055 is a 9-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) that provides orientation and motion data. It includes a 3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis gyroscope, and a 3-axis magnetometer, allowing it to provide accurate orientation information. We specifically
 used the IMU to record the robot's heading and to help with the line following algorithm.

- **Bump Sensors**: The Romi robot is also equipped with bump sensors that can detect obstacles in its path. These sensors are typically used to stop the robot or change its direction when an obstacle is detected. We used the bump sensors to stop the robot when it made
   contact with the wall specifically.

Final Configuration
*******************

This is the final configuration of the Romi robot, including all the components mentioned above.
