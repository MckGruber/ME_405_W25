Welcome to the ME405 **Mechatronics** Term Project!

This project is a **line-following Romi robot** using an STM32 Nucleo board and Python-based control logic.

This project features components and algorithms such as:

- **Line Sensor Array** for path detection.

- **PID Motor Control** for smooth movement.

- **Bump Sensors** for obstacle detection.

- **IMU-Based Heading Correction** for accurate turns.

The following sections will describe the hardware, software, and final results of the project in complete detail.
